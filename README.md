### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

It was a little difficult creating a responsive search bar due to time constrainsts in class which the instructors are not at fault for.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have made a feature to wrap the extra long titles to a second line in order for some fit issues to be resolved. I would add more styling to show more personality and things lke alt text to make my page more accessible.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I got great feedback on my demo from my peers congradulating me on successfully walking them through my thought process while resolving a bug in my code while sucessfully using my actual code as an example and being aable to explain my approaches to solving a bug I'm still struggling on. My peers would like me to add more styling to show personality.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
